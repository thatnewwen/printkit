Mostly it was Yangon's nightlife through my eyes, infused with the sentiment of falling out of love with the city. The series was created in 2023. I drew them because I was sad.

            Turns out sexuality is attached in you as an essential part of your being. However, when being homosexual is considered wrong, you want to cut yourself out. As you cut, you bleed in color. As I am my being, I have to constantly remind myself by splitting myself and tell the other me 'It is OK.' I hope I am listening.

            When I was a high school student, my friends and I could only play chin lone due to a lack of space for other sports. Chin lone is a team sport, allowing for 2 to 15 players. I had numerous memorable moments with this sport, which I am unable to recreate today. As a result, I created an illustration called "Chin Lone" to capture those memories.

A spectral play evolves between the pixels as an act of intimate connection born from an enigmatic embrace of distinction. As a person who experienced the challenges of losing both parents during early childhood and adolescence, I experienced a chaotic journey marked by transitions from one household to another due to financial constraints and difficult living conditions. I am currently living far away from my family, relatives, and friends. These circumstances have compelled me to develop resilience and adaptability in order to survive. Despite suffering from clinical depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and extreme introversion, I have overcomed the hardship to connect with diverse people and collaborate effectively, even when our perspectives do not fully align.
